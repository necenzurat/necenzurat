I'm a modern man. 
A man for the millenium. 
Digital and smoke free. 
A diversified multicultural postmodern deconstructionist, politically, anatomically, and ecologically incorrect. 
I've been uplinked and downloaded, I've been inputted and outsourced. 
I know the upside of downsizing I know the downside of upgrading. 
I'm a high tech lo-life. 
A cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, bi-coastal multitasker and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond. 
I'm new wave but I'm old school and my inner child is outward bound. 
I'm a hotwired, heatseaking, warmhearted cool customer, voice activated and biodegradable. 
I interface with my database and my database is in cyberspace, so I'm interactive, I'm hyperactive, and from time to time I'm radioactive. 
Behind the eight ball, ahead of the curve, riding the wave, dodging the bullet, and pushing the envelope. 
I'm on point, on task, on message, and off drugs. 
I got no need for coke and speed. 
I got no urge to binge and purge. 
I'm in the moment, on the edge, over the top, but under the radar. 
A high concept, low profile, medium range ballistic missionary. 
A streetwise smartbomb. 
A top-gun bottom feeder. 
I wear power ties; I tell power lies; I take power naps; I take victory laps. 
I'm a totally ongoing bigfoot, slamdunk rain maker with a pro-active outreach, a raging workaholic, a working rage-a-holic, out of rehab and in denial. 
I got a personal trainer, a personal shopper, a personal assistant, and a personal angenda. 
You can't shut me up, you can't dumb me down, cause I'm tireless and I'm wireless. 
I'm an alpha-male on beta-blockers. 
I'm a non-believer and an overacheiver, laid-back but fashion foward, up front, down home, low rent, high mantinence, supersize, long lasting, high definition, fast acting, oven ready, and built to last. 
I'm a hands on, footloose, knee-jerk headcase, prematurely postraumatic, and I have a love child who sends me hate mail. 
But I'm feeling; I'm caring; I'm healing; I'm sharing; a supportive, bonding, nurturing, primary caregiver. 
My output is down, but my income is up. 
I take a short position on the long bond and my revenue stream has its own cash flow. 
I read junk-mail; I eat junk food; I buy junk bonds; I watch trash sports. 
I'm gender specific, captial intensive, user friendly, and lactose intolerant. 
I like rough sex; I like tough love; I use the f-word in my email, and the software on my hard drive is hardcore; no soft porn. 
I bought a microwave at a minimall; I bought a minivan at a megastore. 
I eat fast food in the slow lane. 
I'm toll free, bite size, ready to wear, and I come in all sizes; a fully equipped, factory authorized, hospital tested, clinically proven, scientifically formulated medical miracle. 
I've been pre-washed, pre-cooked, pre-heated, pre-screened, pre-approved, pre-packaged, post-dated, freeze-dried, double wrapped, vacuum packed, and I have an unlimited broadband capacity. 
I'm a rude dude but I'm the real deal, lean and mean, cocked, locked, and ready to rock; rough, tough, and hard to bluff. 
I take it slow; I go with the flow; I ride with the tide; I got glide in my stride; driving and moving, sailing and spinning, jiving and grooving, wailing and winning. 
I don't snooze, so I don't lose. 
I keep the pedal to the metal and the rubber on the road. 
I party hardy and lunchtime is crunchtime. 
I'm hanging in, there ain't no doubt, and I'm hanging tough, over and out.
